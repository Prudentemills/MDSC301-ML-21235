Garima,4,SO FAR GOOD TV IN PRICE RANGE,2 September 2022,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"I am writing this after using for it for more than a month. I got it around 26k which quite good deal for 50 inch. Following are the views on  this tv.Quite good picture quality for 4K HD video, specially for indian tv shows and movies, as it has saturated red color. As some of said brightness is not good in the tv and I feel that is TRUE and mainly  affects when you are watching dolby vision or hdr content on netflix or prime video. With less brightness you will not feel something extra which a 4k tv must show. Dolby vision and hdr content  are quite flat or say simple as normal HD tv on this. That might be  common for most of the tv's  in this range.Memc  or reality flow is just an marketing gimic and it's better to turn it off as it increase blurred effect. Sometimes There is hang issue on netflix only. Screen is reflective so if you have bulb or light opposite to tv it will reflect on the tv,  so you need to turn off the light which is common in most tv's.So if someone wants better dolby vision ready picture quality then go for some good qled tv.I am not fan of Google voice recognition as it's not always accurate. So nothing new on tv.Patchwall is not useful for me but live tv option is good and useful.Sound quality is good enough for a room,may be not for big hall. I  cant expect much more with sound quality when there is no in built soundbar. Different sound settings on the tv makes really difference  so you can change settings.No dolby atmos support atleast without soundbar, which was false specifications  mentioned on the product details.Turn on off time is OK and manageble.Build quality is not that important as it always hangs on wall and practically bazeless  design and with less bazele is same thing as without bazel screen has black outline and in slim bazel design those black area covered in plastic bazelss so just a matter of perception.So far I can't comment on customer support as didn't required, but Amazon service was good enough for installation. 500 rs was charged for wall mount which I was aware already so no issues. Better MI should provide  it in the box.I feel MI should provide hot key for you tube on remote as it most watch app, because of kids.Hoping this tv works for long time as my old tv.",63 people found this helpful

shashikanth,4,Review after using for 2 months,23 September 2022,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"Display is simply extraordinary at this price range.But Sound quality is not up to the mark.In the initial days, sound was always also good to hear, but from last 20days, I found that sound quality has completely decreased.We used to keep volume at 9 or 10 in the initial days, but now the same sound is being heard even at the volume of 26 -30.Especially I'm facing this problem from all OTT platforms & Mira Cast.(Ytube is fineüëç)Pros :- Price, Display, Wifi connectivity, Blutooth connectivity, Picture, Colours, Patchwall.Cons :- Sound, material quality, Basic blutooth remote, Google assistant voice recognition is also not satisfied.Overall.... Best Budget TV, except the major problem of sound quality during OTT apps & MiraCast.Alternative option :- Can go with OnePlus for better branding experience.",26 people found this helpful

Ray L.,4,Paisa Vasool,1 August 2022,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"I got this for around 19800 (SBI Credit Card discount 3000 + amazon pay balance + discounted price of around 28900 rupees during the prime sale). So all in all, I'm very satisfied simply because of the price I paid. If this is going to be your first smart TV and have not used premium products like Samsung, LG, Sony etc. before, you will be very satisfied. But for those who have used these products before, there is no comparison between redmi/mi TVs and any other budget offering and the big brands. The color is all wrong and build quality is pathetic. But remember, this is a budget TV. If you don't have the budget for Sony etc., Redmi is good enough. If you can afford it, spend a little more and get Nokia 4K Or even better, LG/Samsung.Connectivity : you need to use a soundbar/home theater for this TV as the TV speakers are useless.. So connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI ARC OUT of your soundbar and connect the other end to the eARC IN on the TV.  Then use another HDMI cable to connect the HDMI port from your STB/Tata Sky etc. to either HDMI 1 or 3 on the TV. This is for those whose soundbars are ARC enabled. Remember, even if your home theater is Dolby Atmos, (for which eARC is compulsory) you will not get true Atmos unless you have ceiling/overhead speakers. But the sound is quite good. I'm using the Motorola  4.1 AmphisoundX Dolby Atmos 250W Soundbar with the wireless sub-woofer and eARC on the TV and ARC OUT on the soundbar means I use just one remote for both TV and soundbar.All in all, paisa vasool as a secondary TV.

harsha chamarthi,4,Basic smart TV which does the job,7 July 2022,Pattern name: 2K Android SeriesSize name: 32 inches,"I have been looking for a budget smart TV from long time. I just wanted to try redmi 32 smart TV as it has become very popular and has service centres in my vicinity. I bought it for 12k.After a 2 months of usage my opinion about TV are:1. The picture quality is good but not as good as you find in relatively costlier tv of same brand or other brands like Sony or Samsung. You'll never notice this until you place other costly display side by side. I found out this when I screencasted my Manali trip videos from my OnePlus 7t to redmi 32 colours are more vibrant and appealing in my smartphone rather than in this smart tv.2. Sound quality of TV is great to watch webseries and tv serials but for good movie experience or to watch great foreign web series with Dolby, you should get a good sound system. Don't get wrong notion about TV this is the scenario of every smart tv in the market.3. User experience of smart TV is usually good. It has very minor lags or stuttering now and then. Don't install many apps as it has only 4.7 gb of internal storage(you'll get Netflix, prime, YouTube, YouTube music and hot star pre-installed). Try to keep 3gb of internal storage to avoid lags.4. Remote is compact and light. It has dedicated prime, Netflix, hot star, patwall and apps(opens all installed apps) button. It picks up the voice commands clearly. It is advisable to go with voice commands instead of typing in all the applications.Summing up the above words don't expect it to be par with 20-30K or above smart tvs. it is a basic smart TV with good features and good picture quality for the price.",32 people found this helpful

After buying this product sequence of event is going to like this - You will buy the smart TV, schedule the installation, you will get a call from the installation but they won't show up that day. Then you will contact amazon customer care service coz there is no other option. They'll provide you a number and a OTP for the service guy. You'll call that guy, he will deny the service and say he doesn't have your installation on his service list. Then you connect with amazon customer care again, they'll tell you they have noted your problem and spoken to the team and escalated the issue. But you have to reschedule the installation again. Now, reschedule. Again you get a call in the morning and no one shows up. Customer care says they have escalated the issue with installation team. And, reschedule. This cycle keeps going on.Moral of the Story :- They want you to install your TV yourself, This helps amazon and brand of the TV. As soon as you open the box yourself, warranty is void. If the product is faulty they can blame you for opening the box yourself and not waiting for the so called expert.THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF DELAYING THE INSTALLATION IS TO MAKE YOU FRUSTRATED AND MINIMISING THEIR LIABILITY.",12 people found this helpful

Audio is good after some update but remote button need to press for everytime to increaseyou need to double press volume down button to MUTE it in case many are not aware.3. Bluetooth is choosy and do not connect automatically to JBL speakers however worked fine for my headphones. I installed beach buggy game with joystick and it works smoothly.  I also installed some retro console games and used redgear gamepad which worked quite well for contra etc.4. Finally it is good if you get a good piece , however buying without extended warranty is not suggested as many seem to have conked off after an year of usage.Kindly ping me  - dpak4u at yah oo if you have experienced similar issue",24 people found this helpful

Obviously you can't compare it to a Sony or Samsung but it's good enough. I don't feel the need to go for more expensive brands. BUT you can definitely feel the cost cutting when it comes to the TV frame. Delicate plastics all around. Please be gentle when handling the screen. Not giving it a 5 star rating because I've been facing random crashes with the Netflix app.Service centers are more spread out, so that's a leg up compared to other brands like Nokia, TCL, OnePlus, etc.Inbuilt speakers are average. I would recommend getting a sound bar or home theater system to really take advantage of the Dolby audio.It is not energy rated - this means it will suck up a lot of electricity.IMPORTANT: Make sure you take a video of the unboxing upon delivery. Apparently you need it for warranty access. It is clearly written on the box - to be opened in front of MI service rep. You can confirm this with their customer care.I recommend it.",3 people found this helpful

Muqthar Ahmed,4,Excellent display marred by a slow processor,10 May 2022,Pattern name: 2K Android SeriesSize name: 43 inches,"Bough it for approx. 20k on deal, and its a bang for buck. The display quality is excellent with deep blacks and it can go pretty bright as well (I keep my backlight strength at 35, the default is 100).My gripe is all about how crippling the processor is. It takes a good amount of patience to switch between apps and get your media content going! And the software tends to get buggy, where YouTube refuses to open (absolutely no response when clicked on the app icon), or Hotstar crashing on boot. An occasional factory reset will solve these issues but its not very convenient to set up your apps and settings all over again, is it?The built it in media player can register contents of my portable HDD, and can play video files of most formats without breaking a sweat. However, there is no way to display subtitles when used in this mode. That's an oversight from Xiaomi.Also, the mic in my TV remote seems faulty as it doesn't register any voice commands. But I am sure that I will get it replaced under warranty.",One person found this helpful

We paid 500 for purchasing that from the installation person. It could have been included for the same price while purchasing tv.- Software and the navigation between apps and setting feels laggy. But it is expected for this price range.- The panel(screen) is very sensitive. One can feel that by gently pressing it.,

Must clean frequently.>Picture Quality - Good ,tested auto mode and customised than find the right one. Don't sit too close for better experience. 4/5>Sound- 4/5 don't break at high volume.>SOFTWARE-2/5Good in starting but delays now. It's like taking time for engine to heat up üòÇbut than works fine. UI not actually lag it just delays in starting few min. Not. Freezing or hangs.>connectivity-1/5 Perfect in starting but not not at all good and that's why i rated low i software coz that connectivity issue probably due to software.They can resolve by OTA update. For eg.1)Cast feature now not working need a lot of effort it disconnects wifi and than i turn on and tap on cast connect,it disconnects tv from wifi2) to connect your PC if u think of using VGA TO HDMIConnector but i came to know that they burn after sometime even if u buy expensive one.the solution for tht is use graphic card in pc and connect via HDMI to HDMI3) Wifi connectivity is disappointing now like it will show saved on wifi name doesn't connect and you need to restart TV from power menu.When u starting up from beginning like power off to power on in phones it connects ,but disconnect issue come while on running Setup box and shifting to TV/YT.(Restart is solution for now)4)Voice recognition on Google assistant is not at all good. Don't know how to pronounce words for it's assistentMy mom's voice have better recognition (saying kanha ji k bhajan) me saying skyesports not recognised correctly>>Accessories-2/5Doesn't come with wall mount. got one from offline market at cheap price.>Came with Stand which is not sturdy. It may fall.>Will be more rated if they Give some update fixing the software and disconnecting issue (less chance for any or  early resolution)Overall 3.5/5 as a product and at <27K price 4/5 for a 50 inch chinese 4K LED.Edit-That wifi disconnection is more pathetic now.

Sai Rohit,3,Not up to the mark,1 November 2021,Pattern name: 2K Android SeriesSize name: 32 inches,"Nov 2, 2021 : Redmi 32"" tv ordered on 3rd October delivered on 7th October.Installation done by delivery executives only no seperate technician visit from redmi or any.User of Samsung 32"" led tv from 2013 and a oneplus y series in another room almost a year. Bought this to replace Samsung tv in hall. As a comparison this is not up to the mark with both. Wall mount was old Samsung one so no extra accessories. Bought this at 12,221 with 400 cashback. Effective price of 11821/-.Picture quality: not good but average. Black levels are not good.Sound quality: the worst. I can't find any dolby settings as mentioned.Software, UI : android tv 11 with storage of 3.56gb available out of the box. Lot of lag. Switching between apps takes a time of 10-20sec. Sometimes doesn't open at all. No ota update till date as mentioned for quick settings ( ota for tv or remote idk but quick settings not working).Google assistant: works 5/10 times.Network: though the router is in same room reception is not good. Signal strength and speed is less. One plus tv 2 rooms away has better reception on both 2.4 & 5ghz than this. Also i placed my Samsung tv with amazon firestick 1st gen on 1st floor even that has acceptable strength on 5ghz. Utter disappointed with this.Energy consumption: i tested with wipro smart plug and on avg tv usage of 6-8hrs per day energy consumption ranges from 0.37-0.87. But with 1hr ott content 0.97+ observed this 5-6 times.  So, who are planning to purchase only for ott beware about electricity bills. This is okay for families as most of the time setup box is used. So, 1star energy rated tv in 2021 is really con but some mentioned it as not.Display & build quality: cheap quality plastic and discoloration with just a touch on display.Conclusion: Consider this as entry level smart tv. Under 12000 its okay (even 12k is more i think )  but above that never consider redmi & mi for 32"" atleast.  On comparison i prefer oneplus y series 32"" tv which i bought at 12,500/-  over this.Nov 3, 2021 : Yesterday i wrote my comple review and today i got ota update what a coincidence üòÖ.  Update description1. Improved picture quality 2. Improved audio quality 3. Improved performance optimizationThough i didn't find any improvements in above mentioned ota changes quick settings now available. Long press patchwall open quick settings finally. Other than that no other improvements. Lag increased. Update & installation took whole 40min with 200mbps jio fiber bb connection.",7 people found this helpful

Many online reviews says brightness is low as compare to others but does not feel at all. Picture quality, viewing angels are very good. Screen is having reflection its not anti reflection hence if there is windows or any bright light from external source then it affect viewing experience. Sound quality of inbuilt speakers are ok. Base is not punchy at all sound is having loudness but when you listening to dialogs and you set volume level and then whenever some music starts it gets much more louder than expected hence have to keep playing with volume levels(Sometimes it depends on App as well). Installation was done on next day from third party. Sometimes remote response is laggy once in 100 times i will say.

Software is a bit glitchy but the thing that bothers me the most is the horrendous sound quality. Bass is non existent, I have heard better bass from small Bluetooth speakers from Sony, JBL etc. The 20W Dolby and DTS gimmicks do not translate to good sound. It sounds thin and there is an irritating hiss around the higher frequencies. I am not expecting hifi sound from any flat panel given the physical limitations but this is quite unbearable and several of my family members commented on it. And this is not a defect because I have heard the same crappy sound on their larger TVs at a friend's house. I thought I would compensate using a sound system. Then again, it doesn't have bluetooth connectivity, so you have to solely depend on the 3.5 mm jack.",2 people found this helpful

Sachin,4,Mixed bag of emotions,11 June 2021,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"Got my Redmi x50 delivered. Here are my first impressions after 1 day of usage.Pros1.) Upscaler is great. TV upscales the basic 720p and 1080p content really well and it's no less than Sony x-reality chipset. Even my old PS3 looks great on this TV. Also tested Base PS4 and it looks gorgeous. Ensure you enable HDMI 2.1 so u can enjoy HDR on consoles.2.) Os is lag free and setup was fast3.) MEMC is not in a separate chip but is software based but it's good for sport content or documentary videos. Don't use it for movies though as it gives a soap opera effect. Also don't use it when gaming as it will make your games stutter and lag.4.) TV switches to game mod when you put a console and it reduces input lag.5.) Display quality is great for the price. Company does not mention it but Brightness is around 250-300 nits and it's bright enough.6.) Sound quality is good enough for a bedroom. If you want to put it in a a huge hall. U will need a soundbar7.) Extended warranty of 1yr can be purchased for just 999 extra.Cons1.) U can't adjust brightness contrast etc while using TV as there are no buttons in remote to do that. You need to come back to patchwall screen and then adjust TV settings through android settings. It's a huge problem and because of this color calibrating this TV is a huge pain.2.) Customer care has been a pain trying to facilitate installation. I had to escalate and raise complaint and then too they had no idea when engineer will come for installation. Finally installed it myself. Engineer came later and took pictures of installation to register my warranty. If you install it. Make sure to take full video of unboxing and installation.3.)HDR leaves a lot to be desired. If you have seen real HDr displays then u know how HDR separates the dark and light areas. This screen does not do that really well. So don't expect too much from this. But I guess it's why it's cheap.Overall for this price range it is a great buy. If you can spend more, go for Samsung Crystal series. The customer care is much better and overall HDR quality of Samsung is better too. Though u will pay 50% more, the HDR quality is worth it.",25 people found this helpful

Athul Tuttu Baby,4,Good budget option with minor issues in the display,2 February 2022,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 55 inches,"The TV has average build quality which is expected. The Android tv performance is also average. Doesn't seem like a 2gb ram unit. However, all the features are there which makes it value for money.Coming to display, it had an issue out of the box for Dolby vision content when horizontal scrolling black lines were visible bottom up when backlight is reduced or when viewing Dolby vision content in which case backlight is adjusted automatically. Got this fixed with a firmware update from Mi service centre. Stillt he HDR performance is average for content which favours dark atmosphere. There are somuch noise appearing in the picture. I observed this while watching Daredevil on Netflix. But this is okay considering the cost for me. Bright HDR content looks good. Otherwise picture clarity is awesome. I feel there is enough backlight to watch indoors. Panel is a bit reflective though. Overall I would say awesome value for money tv provided no major issues pop up.Update:Even though the horizontal moving black lines were fixed by Firmware update from service centre, it is still present maybe about 10% of what it used to be. It is only visible in 1 out of 1000 frames with some particular background colors while watching HDR content and only if you look closely. I feel it's not an eyesore as it used to be earlier and hence acceptable. It's not moving as fast earlier as well or not moving at all. Not ble to tell because the frame changes in video and you can't see it anymore. Not sure what these lines are!!!",One person found this helpful

Speed:- one of the main reason I went for this tv is that it has 2gb ram as opposed to most of the others which only had 1 or 1.5gb. my old TV had a 1gb ramn and it was painfully slow and very frustrating to use. Very happy with the performance of this tv.2:- picture quality:- is bang on, if you have been using a 2k tv you can instantly see the improvement in picture quality.3:- storage space:- it has a decent amount of storage capacity.Cons:-Sound:- I felt it's a bit lacking in the sound quality.Remote:- feels like they should have had a few more functions.should have kept a seperate button for mute. It's annoying to contol in just 1 button.They should have also given the wall mounts. Overall, a 43 inch 4k smart tv for 28k rs is a pretty good deal.",4 people found this helpful

Could have been the best one if it had more storage and RAM.Screen quality is good, however there is no mention about the type of display it uses. The one I have received has good wide angle viewing and am happy with the overall quality.Sound quality is decent but while watching a movie the volume increases whenever music plays but have whenever dialogues are being spoken the sound is low. Have to keep adjusting the volume levels everytime this happens.The tv is powered by Android TV which allows one to install apps however this particular model comes with low 8GB internal space and most of it is occupied by the os and also the patchwall interface which hasn't been much useful for me.Also 1 GB RAM is too low given that it sometime utilizes upto 80% which makes the apps hang many times.Have faced issues with MX Player TV very frequently. While using memory boost and optimization helps to some extent, the app freezes quite frequently. The TV has also restarted a few times on its own after getting hanged while watching YouTube. Maybe an additonal 1 GB ram would have helped to avoid these problems.Build quality is decent but light weight. Remote is also nice and is a bluetooth enabled one with inbuilt mic for using voice search which works well.",One person found this helpful

Their serviceman came and verified everything and then said there is an issue with panel and it would needs to be replaced. However, MI RTTS team has canceled replacement with reason that it's a water issue.TV is wall mounted in a secure dry place, there is no leakage of water anywhere near TV, still my replacement was rejected.What is the point of having warranty if MI rejects replacement without even checking the component.Rejection for replacement happened only by looking at photos and videos submitted by MI service person. Even service person was not sure that it will get replaced as he didn't see any scope of external damage to TV.Pathetic customer service by MI. Really disappointed.Update:After a couple of follow-ups with MI and with a new service request, MI has replaced the TV unit with a new one.Amazon Customer Support has helped and provided better guidance during this fiasco.",7 people found this helpful

vidya sagar,5,Complete value for money,30 January 2022,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"I previously own a Mi 32inch 4A Pro model.I had purchased that TV as a stop-gap solution but ended up using it for almost 2 Yrs as it was quite good and satisfied all my requirements except the screen size. There wasn't a single issue with that TV during the course, so, when it came to buying a 50 inch TV I couldn't really keep Mi / Redmi out of the list.After doing a bit of research, I zeroed in on Redmi x50 and Mi 5X. Mi 5X was costing almost 10K extra and I couldn't find enough reasons to spend 10K extra for that. So, finally went with this 50inch TV during the republic day sale and I must say that this is a complete value for money.Picture / Video:It shows any 1080p / 4K content exceptionally well. The colors are good and I didn't observe any saturation as such. Although reviewers are criticizing it for having low nits (around 250) brightness. I didn't find it that low and the brightness levels are pretty good. I think unless you have that eye for brightness, there is no issue as such.When it comes to upscaling the normal setup box non-HD content, it does Ok Ok. Not great and not terrible either. Keep your expectations lower. In my case, I subscribed to HD versions of all the channels we regularly watch, so, life is good now.Android TV experience has been great as usual. The whole SW stack is reasonably faster and does the job perfectly fine.Audio:The speakers are good for this ""price range"". Don't expect high bass or any fancy features. All I can say is that they do a pretty good job. For anything extra, go for a soundbar.My old Mi TV had issues with Bluetooth in the sense that connecting any Bluetooth headset always has lagged in the audio. This is not the case with this TV. You can connect your high-end Bluetooth headset and watch movies without disturbing others in the house. There is no lag and everything works perfectly fine.Overall, I would say, this is a perfect value-for-money TV with the most sought-after features. If your budget is around 30K and looking for a 50inch TV, just go for it.",One person found this helpful

And I was surprised by this, never seen this fast delivery in village.-Good Value for money product.-Adequate connectivity options, 3 hdmi (hdmi 1 is ARC), 2 USB, 1 3.5 MM audio jack. WIFI, Bluetooth-Thin bezels- Build quality is decent and it's light weight- Patch wall UI is nicer then stock android- Decent Picture quality and Sound - Apperently Xiaomi has better service network then real me or one plus.-Bluetooth and wifi built in Chromecast built in-Very good video quality-Rich sound output Google assistant key in remote-The TV really justifies its price. You cannot compare this TV's feature with high end TV of Samsung and Sony that is absurd.-Video Quality is quite great just that when you view from an angle the intensity of colour changes which is fine concerning the price of the TV-Sound Quality is awesome. It has 20W dual speakers which is quite great and once again don't compare it's speaker with high end TV having Speakers like DJ's Please.Conclusion: If you are planning to buy particularly this TV go for it. You wouldn't regret. Actually even I was confused among 2-3 TV while I was making an order but eventually I choose this and I'm quite happy with it. Tick Tick ""Purely Honest Review I wasn't paid by Mi or Flipkart to write this elaborated review"". I'm writing this elaborated review because the buyers who are coming over here to make the purchase should get proper info regarding this TV and they should not have any confusions which I actually faced earlier. Thank You Mi",4 people found this helpful
Prakash Ramani,4,Good for the price,29 March 2022,Pattern name: 2K Android SeriesSize name: 32 inches,"It's a good TV for the price. However, it could have a better picture quality.  When I connect a firestick to the TV, I get better image quality. However, the same color reproduction is not available in native apps. Also, videos freeze while streaming from apps.The sound quality is amazing. Sometimes, I felt like a bird was really chirping near my house, I then learnt that it was the TV.The remote is minimalistic and works really well.Android Home vs PatchWall is a bit too much for the TV to handle. It takes a long time and sometimes, it just ends up restarting the TV.To be honest, I bought this TV because it promises 75+ free channels. But, that's not free, you need to subscribe to multiple apps to get those free channels. This was a huge let down for me.",One person found this helpful

nisarg pednekar,3,"Picture quality - 5/10, Sound quality - 8/10, Build quality - 5/10, Processor smoothness - 6/10",14 February 2022,Pattern name: 2K Android SeriesSize name: 32 inches,"So I ordered this tv on 13th feb and got it delivered by 15th feb monday. #1 The quality of the product didn‚Äôt meet the expectations i had after researching it‚Äôs reviews by amazon buyers and YouTube content creators. Youtubers and individual reviewers repeatedly preached about the picture colour brightness while comparing it to other same range TVs. But it‚Äôs after experiencing the tv screen right in front of my eyes that i noticed the colours were bright, but not as premium, realistic and satisfying as expected. So please don‚Äôt just notice the colour quality but do consider the quality of experience you get while comparing it with other TVs. #2 major default i found on my tv screen is.. if you increase your phone brightness and carefully notice all corners of the screen, you will see a slight black coloured faded tint which overtly conveys that the display quality is absolutely not premium. It looks cheap and fragile. #3 The bezel of the TV is slightly pulled away from the display panel and a white gum/powder like substance can be seen as I‚Äôve shown in the picture below. Again, cheap build quality. #4 Even though the TV supports android 11 but that literally doesn‚Äôt favours the processing smoothness while it comes to switching through apps, going back to the home page and restarting the tv. It takes time and is noticeably laggy. Maybe it‚Äôs the low quality processor and not android 11. Bottom line of my personal review.. the product didn‚Äôt reach my expectations after all the research, display panel & build quality seems cheap, processor is laggy, overall product is overpriced. I have reported a replacement for the issues regarding black tints on the display corners and the white gum that‚Äôs visible between the bezel and display panel. I will update if amazon replaces the TV and i get a clean display screen.  Thankyou",One person found this helpful

I got the TV after 1 day.Coming to the TV. Everything is flawless. Picture quality is amazing and 4k movies works like a charm. The only con is sound could have been better. Cause other tvs with 30w sound have better sound system. But if you have a small room you won't find anything to complain. Other than this everything in this TV is exceptional at this price range. If you have a price range of 28k just go for it,One person found this helpful

The tv does not have a game mode. That means the performance will not be adequate at times and you may see sturtering when you connect your gaming console.

For 30K ~34K this is good buy. My last LED tv of Philips was great but the water spilled on it damaged the panel permanently,  which means any TV Panel is of the same story, so not worth to spend too much on Television these days unlike in the past. This TV itself is of 4K quality and support Android apps like PrimeVideo, Netflix, Hotstar etc..with wifi and connects in couple of minutes. The sound is decent too.",

Jithin,3,Replacement process was tough,15 May 2022,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 43 inches,I replaced my first tv.. and i struggled alot to initiate the replacement.The first tv i recieved was not working well. The screen will go black after some time of plating the video. But we could hear the audio. Initially i thought  it was a setting like audio only mode. But it was not.. i requested for replacement.  They told me that they will send a technician to inspect the issue. But no one has come.. i waited almost 1 week..  and after my continues pressure on the support team somebody updated status like they have inspected my tv and it has issue (but catually they didn't come for inspection). Anyway they have initiated the replacement afte that. I got the replacement tv within 2 weeks. And there is no issues so far.,One person found this helpful

poojasanjeevrana,3,Worst Installation experience,1 May 2021,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"1). I ordered this TV few days ago. Installation guy was not on time even though I got a specific time slot on MI portal for installation. He kept me waiting for a longer period of time thus hampering my other commitments. When he finally came, he did not have swivel (movable) wall mount stand with him even though I registered for movable stand on MI portal, clearly reflects bad coordination between installation guys and MI. Later, he demanded more money for non-movable stand, more than what is mentioned on MI portal itself, he showed me forged image of installation charges and TV stands on his phone wherein he mentioned his own charges. He kept on demanding 700 for a stand of 499.2). When I ordered this TV on Amazon in April, there was no option to select 'MI Extended warranty' which is usually available when you order product from MI store website. Later I talked with Amazon customer care and they tole me to contact with MI itself for same.3). It is mentioned on TV box that 'Do not open- warranty voids if box opened not in the supervision of an engineer'. Amazon and MI should clear the definition of engineer to their customers as lot of people like me gets confused that who is qualified engineer whether is it Amazon delivery person who offers product inspection while delivery or the MI installation guy who will visit later on for the product installation. This needs to be cleared in order to avoid any blame game between two parties if something goes unexpected with product while shipment and installation.",85 people found this helpful

Have decent number of ports including one HDMI port supporting eArc.# Audio quality #It is one of the weak points of the TV. It is good enough for watching news, daily soaps and sports. For watching movies where the range of highs and lows is more, an external soundbar is recommended.# UI #MI's patchwall interface works great. There is no lag with the interface.

Bhargavi P S,4,Good.Could be better,12 November 2021,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"Stand and body are plastic. Quality could have been better. Display is definitely not the best in terms of resolution, quality and brightness. Brightness is on the lower side. Sound of not great but good.Patchwall UI works like a charm and it is the best pro point in it. No handsfree voice assistant can't ask at this price point maybe.No lags no display leaks.  Finally display and brightness could've been better and remaining everything is good at this price point.  If price is the constraint at 30k for a 50 inch one. You may not find a better one.So go for it. But if you choose 43inch at 30K there are better TV's in terms of display.",One person found this helpful

samar dash,3,Honnest Review 3*,12 June 2021,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"I am using it from last 5 days.Here is the review.Display : 4/5Not mentioned about brightness and pannel but you will never know if you will get a IPS or VA. But in home you will never feel low brightness.Speaker: 2/530W inbuilt, You might get good amount of sound in DTH but as a smart tv in OTT you can't find good sound as others 20W speaker can produce.Another note inbuilt sound speaker don't suppose Dolby audio please be aware, if you want Dolby sound then you need go for a soundbar or other external sound system.Processor : 4/5No lag, 2 GB ram and media tech processor works fine.Picture quality : 3.5/5Some improvement needed, when you see something loading and you press volume button and you see the volume area in screen also blinking like loading up down. Like this you will face lots of up down scren flickering in time of loading or refreshing.Wifi : 4.5 /5Both band support, no issues so far.Bluetooth : 3/5Sound is very low in bluetooth, no option to connect or disconnect paired devices everytime you need to add and connect. You need 100 percent volume in bluetooth on OTT.Build quality: 3.5/5It's plastic but we never use it mobile so it will be in wall and be untouched. Main point is in case of stand in table it move in case of fan air flow.Power :140W running, make sure you have signwave inverter to work continuously, in my home it's old inverter and it keep shut when power goes and i need to power again it on even in inverter on.",4 people found this helpful

Amritesh Kumar Sinha,5,Best in all departments.,11 August 2021,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"I got a great deal on this TV. Purchased for 27k, at this price for a 50 inch TV I can't complain.Coming to the pros and cons.Pros:1. Excellent picture quality.2. Streams HDR, 4k and dolby vision content with no issues.3. Motion smooth feature works great, one needs to calibrate it as per the content.4. All ports and connectivity features available.5. Sound is loud and clear with some catch, will explain in cons.6. Android 10 out of the box.7. Price is truly value for money.Cons:1. When you try the preset sound profiles, you don't get clear sound in few content and it's weird. For some videos sound will be amazing but for some videos and content it is not clear. Sometimes we don't hear the vocals clearly. But, when you use the custom sound profile and set it optimally you will be able to minimize the sound issue. For the long run one should buy a sound bar (just a suggestion, depends on personal preference).So far after using it for 2+ months I am happy and satisfied with the experience.It came out to be a good buy for me.As always Kudos to amazon for delivering the product before expected time. But the gap between the order date and delivery date was almost 2 weeks. That could have been better. At the end no complaints as I got a good product.Thanks!!Editing the review after 3 months usage:The sound issue is gone after a software update. Now the sound is loud, crisp and clear.But now the TV's price is also gone way higher than earlier. Consider this a good option as other brands are also offering value for money in this price range.Thanks!!",4 people found this helpful

Amazon Customer,3,Just OK smart TV,13 October 2021,Pattern name: 2K Android SeriesSize name: 43 inches,what I like1. Pricing. I got it at approx 20K2. Light weightWhat I didn‚Äôt like:1. Picture quality on HD setup box. Over saturated colors which are not pleasant to eyes2. Sound: The dialogues are hardly audible and if you increase the sound everything seems like it‚Äôs screaming3. Low grade processor. The TV doesn‚Äôt feel snappy. Sometimes the TV get jitters while playing FHD movies via OTT apps4. Casting via VLC player for FHD content is horrible as well.5. Going back from patchwall or android tab to input tab feels laggy. I had to restart quite a few times to see the cable tv6. Build quality is average at best. Just check by touching the bezels on touch. It will bend upon pressing gently7. It seems there is a lot of space between screen and bezel & i think dust will enter into the panelIt‚Äôs is just Okay TV. Nothing so fab about it. My advise: Go for a 1.5 or 2 gb ram TV and with a better processor. This TV comes with cortex a35 which is the most basic and low grade processor,2 people found this helpful

The hardware part of the TV is good, great speakers, good picture quality, a little on the less brighter side though and good screen in general. But it is the software which is poor. The power on off button stops working suddenly with a software upgrade, google the brand and you will understand its a big issue for many. Thankfully a youtuber gave a work around. OTT apps are also not recognised accurately by the TV, like i have Sony liv installed twice, not sure how that is even possible, but yes patchwall is poor in those terms. Even voice search is restricted to certain apps, doesnt take everything into account.So overall if you need a better software please dont go for this, i consider myself decent enough when it comes to usage of technology, but can only imagine what other homes would do with such a waste of technology.",One person found this helpful

Media player is able to play the video files  which are 20GB+5. Responsive UI, though I feel once I day complete restart will be required to keep it responsive.6. Sports content plays decently7. SD and HD upscaling is really good.8. Viewing angles are good.9. Patch wall is very user friendly, which can scan all our OTT apps to suggest required content.Cons :1. Green patch appeared one or two times.. I'll be happy if it doesn't become regular affair.2. When Bluetooth headphone is connected youtube video disappears.3. Amazon prime videos stop playing all of a sudden.4. Dark scenes are a pain to watch. If you watch horror movies often, don't buy this tv.5. Youtube ""stats for nerds"" shows viewport resolution as 1080p when while playing 4k videos, which is strange.6. Netflix movies are quite grainy, watch 'Da Vinci code' for example. The film is UHD res as per Netflix, but in reality is extremely grainy.7. Display build quality is pathetic, to reflective. If there are kids in home, this panel definitely  won't last long.Hopefully 2nd and 3rd items in this list are software glitches and will get fixed in future updates.",One person found this helpful

Second, i was carried away by the features highlighted in Redmi. Seriously, i feel the VU was way better in picture clarity as well as the sound quality.

But Thanks to Amazon they provided replacement quickly.Pros:1. Big Screen 50 inch with Superb Display Quality. HDR10+ , 4K UltraHD fantastic picture quality2. Sound 30W speakers truly amazing.3. Easy to configure WiFi and easy to Install any APP (no need of any  third party stick)4. 4k Quality pitures / videos are giving truly amazing experience. Must watch and worth. If you don't know what it is, go to YouTube App on TV and search for 4K Videos. See few nature videos. You will see clear difference between HD videos and 4K videos. 8K Videos are also displayed superbly.5. Watching Movie is good experience. There are multiple display options, Standard / Vivid / Movie / etc. Best mode is Vivid.6. Initial setup was set to 50% brightness. But it is adjustable, so not a big deal. Sharpness and Brightness really adds picture clarity.7. Last but not least. Redmi provided excellent Value for Money product. Just in 33K. Excellent latest android 10 TV.Cons:Not yet. If found I will update this section later.But if they could give control to configure and test Dolby Atmos sound would be helpful. It is just Sound configuration you have. So you don't know what Dolby is. But speakers are powerful than any other TV for sure.Just go for it and buy. This is one of the best TV available today.",

The installation guy was in so hurry, he didn't even give any detail demo. He just drilled the cheap wall mount and hung the TV and started it and said everything else is just like smart phone. Inaksed him about flexible wall mount which is mentioned priced at 2300 in Amazon installation service page, he said that comes for 4000 and he doesn't have it.Post that when I gave 3 star for installation a single call came inquiring why I gave 3 star and agreed to send someone to check wall mount and give demo.

Mohan,3,Good in price but not upto the expected quality,29 October 2021,Pattern name: 2K Android SeriesSize name: 32 inches,"Redmi 32in features at this price is a good deal however it is not what we come to expect in a futuristic smart TV. The picture output quality for a cable network is very poor VS a regular led TV (without smart features). Meanwhile picture quality in apps is much better.Voice recognition has lot of issues and takes time sorting it out. Sound output is also nothing special for a TV that boosts itself of being futuristic smart.Expected much better from Redmi. I was using a WU normal led earlier and still cannot get around the thought it had a much better video output in comparison, everytime I watch any program in this new TV",One person found this helpful

Sopan,2,Cheap TV with Cheap Picture Quality.,8 October 2021,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 50 inches,"Pros:1. Very low price (I got it it in ‚Çπ22500 after Exchanging my 8 year old 22 inch TV)2. Supports Dolby Audio and DTS Virtual. It is very useful when I stream online on Netflix or Prime. It gives Very good surround effect with my JLB 5.1 Surround Soundbad compared with my old Amazon Fire TV Stick.3. Android 10.4. Very good picture Quality for 4K 60FPS Video5. Sound is good for the average living room.6. 3 HDMI ports and 2 USB Ports are good for connecting multiple devices.7. Portable hard disk of 5TB can be connected (I personally tested it).Cons:1. Motion Handling: Very bad picture quality for action scenes. Motion handling of this TV is very bad for any type of video whether it's SD, HD, FHD or UHD content.2. 4K Upscaling: When the content is not 4K, the TV tries to upscale it to 4K and while doing it, I have observed some small flicker in the picture which is very irritating for eyes, especially when watching in a dark environment.3. It does support the Dolby vision and HDR10+, but the panel is not capable of handling all the colors. You can easily see the visible difference in color ranges it can handle.4. Surround sound with built-in speakers is only adding echo to sound which is not great at all.In short, having so many advance features is a good thing, but what's the use of those features if the picture quality is very very poor.",2 people found this helpful

Sound quality is good. Some shows do have low volume but that's on them not the speakers. Speakers can work well for a big hall too. Brightness has been talked about a lot. I was watching a documentary and a scene of sun glared my eyeglasses 10 feet away so believe me it's enough bright for the price. The Fluency thing makes sports better. You don't see 3 cricket balls moving like other TVs I've watched cricket on. Make sure you watch in at least HD though. For the display size, anything below HD is too pixelated to watch. 720p looks pretty bad too. There is option for 2.0 HDMI for 60 fps so make sure you're on that setting. Other than that I've been pretty happy with display too. I'm not saying it's the best but I can watch it with an LED bulb on 4 feet away from it so it's not bad at all.",One person found this helpful

TV is delivered by Amazon on 22 Oct 2021 and installed on 13th Nov 2021. As there was no confirmation received on the warranty and extended warranty, called Amazon customer care on 16th Nov 2021 and raised the complaint. Also the agent confirmed that warranty is going to start from the date of installation and extended warranty is going to start post completion of warranty. On 17th Nov 2021, received an email saying warranty is going to start from 7th Oct 2021 and extended warranty starts from 7th Oct 2022. Hence called customer care again on 21st Nov 2021 and raised the concern. Initially he confirmed that warranty is gong to start from the date of purchase. When i raised a concern about how can you start the warranty without even deliver the product, he cross checked and mentioned that warranty will start from the date of delivery and not from the date of purchase. After that he transferred the call to manager, and the manager mentioned that warranty will start from delivery date which is 22nd Oct 2021 and extended warranty will start from 7th Oct 2022. This is again s strange statement. So all the 3 people are giving 3 different statements. If i speak to 4th person then not sure what information i get. Finally manager says that it will remains same and need to believe what she says verbally and they will not change and give anything in writing (even what ever they say verbally also). If anything else require then need to talk to Seller it seems. Not sure how can they say like that. Worst experience in my life.",4 people found this helpful

Considering the price range in which the X series are launched, it is worth of each Penny you are paid.",2 people found this helpful

Later, I called Amazon and another technician visited from their team and confirmed it was display problem and got a replacement unit which is working fine. So,  Support is really not very good. Built-in Google Chrome feature works seamlessly. They could have given a button on remote to switch between hdmi inputs as I use this more often and find it cumbersome. User interface is not very user friendly or simpler.

What if same thing repeats within next 6 months? What if it happens after the warranty period? I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone",3 people found this helpful

Achu,1,Get ready for surprises if u buy this TV,31 January 2022,Pattern name: 2K Android SeriesSize name: 32 inches,"Let's start with pros n consPros,1. Most cheapest Android tv available2. Sound quality is fine3. Picture quality is fine4. TV remote is Bluetooth enabled will work with anywhere5. Comes with latest Android.Now for theCons.1. If u want to watch a movie with screencast forget it, it won't work, 30 minutes later video will be stuck, i replaced tv 2 times still same issue.2. If ur trying with pendrive running a full hd movie also u will face the same issue.3. Interface is very very slow thanks to 1GB ram and medicore processor, takes time to respond4. Tends to freeze many times, though a forcefull shutdown is required always to recover.5. Sound Quality is fine but there are times when we need subtitles to understand due to poor speakers.6. Comes with 1 star energy rating so power consumption is very high.7. TV tends to get heated even when switched off.8. There is no 5ghz wifi, as compared to the price it's expected but connecting to a LAN port is recommended from my side.9. Switching between apps are pain in the u know what..... Due to poor performance.Overall if u ask me there are better options available please don't go for price wise, I made a big mistake and I don't want you to make the mistake I made so think twice before proceedingThank you",8 people found this helpful

When the scene changes picture shakes . It is very slight but it is visible as a low quality tv. Colours are also light , in night scenes its too much dark.Sound is another problem in this tv. When you first switch it on it seems normal but when i played movies i observed that the background voices in the movie are missing. It is playing the dialogues and louder sounds but not the background sounds. Bass is zero.I registered a complaint to return it but amazon customer care executive insisted on getting it installed (why would i get a defective tv installed and het wholes in my wall for nothing??). I waited for the installation guy for the time schedule given to me which was on 6th day after delivery (only 10 days are given to return or replace put of which 6 days they took themselves). That guy called n i shared my location and after 2 hours he is 10 km away from my location n calls me that he has reached. After realising he is far away he reschedules the slot on his own to the evening without taking my consent if i am available or not. Anyways i agreed in my mind. Thn comes a sms from amazon that he has cancelled it n i have to book another slot for instalment. üòØ what the hell. So buy it on your own risks .

Has a very good brightness level.3. Mi provided on-time Installation service at the place of my residence. They even provide with additional warranty for some extra bugs. Thus I believe, the after sale service would be good.Cons:1. Very bad experience with PatchWall. Lags like hell and is too hard to navigate between pages within PatchWall. I had to force stop it and never use it.2. Even Android is pretty laggy. I am not sure whether the issue is with the TV or with the Applications as they are not optimized properly to run in this tv. For Example, Netflix runs smooth whereas App like Hotstar lags a little and Zee5 makes our life miserable.Its your call as there are lots of TV available at this price range. My only reason to go for this TV was the after sale service provided by MI which I hope will be good when compared to other Budget TV Brands who doesn't even have service centres in my city.Edit 2 :After 2 Months of usage, the TV lags a lot. At times, it completely stops working , I will have to switch it off and turn it back on to get it working. If you are going for this TV for the Smart Features just forget it. This is very bad.",

Amazon doesn't provide any support from their side. It's been 3 days since I am contacting Xiaomi and still no service from their side. They keep telling they will provide service in 24 working hours and they have only 8hrs working hours daily. Xiaomi is just fooling people by selling cheap quality products. Please don't waste your money on their crappy products. Go for some other branded products with less features but don't buy from Xiaomi.,3 people found this helpful

Their installation guys are frauds. They will never show up. If you install it by yourself, you warranty will be void. It's been 5 days they are making me rescheduling it but nobody is showing up. Also Amazon,customer support is horrible. Never trust themAbout the product: Overall it is a nice product. But there is a delay if you play videos by mirror casting and through USB. In USB, sometime video will get stuck. You will have to exit and play again whenever you face that. But it will resume from where you stopped. I think huge size videos playing through other resources like USB showing some difficulty to stream.",

Even VU LED plastic quality is far better4) Wi-fi range issue: All other devices in the room showing good wi-fi signal strength whereas there are frequent disconnections of wi-fi with this TV5) Picture quality: Just OK. nothing great about it6) Sound quality: my earlier LCD with 10 W  output was producing better sound quality7) Overall performance: lots of lag while using the interfaceI will recommend to buy a non smart LG or Samsung  LED and use Fire TV with that. I am using this arrangement in other room (which is farther from the wi-fi router) and results are far better.,12 people found this helpful

Abinaya,1,Don't Buy this Redmi X55 TV - Defective Series,10 August 2021,Pattern name: 4K Android SeriesSize name: 55 inches,I ordered Redmi X55 TV in amazon and I received. Then Mi service technician installed the TV. He gave a TV demo.On the same day. At night the rooms were dark so I tried to reduce brightness. But TV's brightness remained same. Then I decreased backlight. Brightness got lowered. There I found an issue. Black line (Screen flickering) is going horizontally from bottom to top.
